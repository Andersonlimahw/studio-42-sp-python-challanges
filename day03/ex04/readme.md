# Django Virtual Environment Setup

This script sets up a virtual environment for Django development. It creates a virtual environment named `django_venv`, installs Django and psycopg2 inside the virtual environment, and activates the virtual environment.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

2. Create a `requirement.txt` file in the same directory as this script with the following content:

2.1 if don't have installed install postGressSQL on <https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/>

3. Run the script `my_script.sh` as follows:

```bash
./my_script.sh

```

The script will create the virtual environment, install the required packages, and activate the virtual environment.

To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:

```bash
  deactivate
```
